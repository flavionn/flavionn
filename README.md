:v: Hello, I am Fl√°vio. Since I started my career I have been working with Visual Design of things - [flavionn.com](https://www.flavionn.com)

I have always been interested in technology and development too. So I worked a few times as developer and wrote frontend and backend code for projects.

In 2021 I decided to focus my career entirely on frontend development.

At this time I'm looking for a frontend job and and bringing life to my own projects learning and using cool things like React, Vue, Nuxt, Vite and Windi CSS
