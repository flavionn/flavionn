### :v: Hello, I'm Flávio.

**I'm a Frontend Developer with over 10 years of experience building software across various sectors like fintech, education, entertainment, and marketplaces.**

What truly motivates me is solving real problems for people and businesses through technology. I see frontend development as the perfect bridge between complex challenges and products that users actually enjoy in their daily lives.

My path into development came through design and full-stack work, but these days I've found my home in frontend development with Vue and Nuxt. I believe good software emerges from organized thinking and structured approaches - I focus on writing clean, maintainable code that can grow over time, and I particularly appreciate tools that make the development process smoother.

I'm always happy to connect and chat about building products that matter!

**Core expertise:** Vue.js, Nuxt, CSS/UnoCSS styling, performance optimization, and cross-team collaboration in agile environments. Currently expanding TypeScript skills.
