:v: Hello, I am Fl√°vio.

Since I started my career I have been working with Visual Design of things - [flavionn.com](https://www.flavionn.com)

But I've always been interested in technology and development too. So, I worked a few times as a developer and wrote front-end and back-end code for projects.

In 2021 I decided to focus my career entirely on frontend development.

At this time I'm looking for a frontend job and bringing life to my own projects, learning and using things like React, Vue, Nuxt, Vite and Windi CSS
