### about me

Since I started my career I have been working with Visual Design of things.

But I've always been interested in technology and development too. So, I worked a few times as a developer and wrote front-end and back-end code for projects.

In 2021 I decided to focus my career entirely on frontend development.

At this time I'm working as frontend developer and bringing life to my own projects.
